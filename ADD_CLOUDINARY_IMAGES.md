# How to Add Your Cloudinary Images to the Website

The images you uploaded to Cloudinary are stored in your account, but they need to be added to your website through the CMS. Here's how:

## Steps to Add Images:

1. **Go to your Admin Panel**
   - https://stalwart-smakager-b57fc1.netlify.app/admin/

2. **Navigate to Galleries**
   - Click on "Galleries" in the sidebar
   - Select "Photography Gallery Images"

3. **Add Each Image**
   - Scroll down to the "Images" section
   - Click "Add images"
   - For each new entry:
     - **Title**: Enter a descriptive title
     - **Image**: Click "Choose an image"
     - **Select from Cloudinary**: Your uploaded images will appear in the media library
     - **Description**: Add a description
     - **Location**: Add location (optional)
     - **Category**: Choose category (landscape, portrait, etc.)
     - **Date**: Set the date

4. **Save**
   - Click "Save" at the top
   - The images will now appear on your photography page

## Important Notes:
- Images uploaded directly to Cloudinary don't automatically appear on your site
- You must add them through the CMS to create the gallery entries
- The CMS acts as the content manager - it decides what appears on the site
- Cloudinary is just the storage/CDN provider

## Quick Tip:
If you have many images, you can:
1. Add multiple "Images" entries at once
2. Each entry = one photo in your gallery
3. Save once after adding all entries
