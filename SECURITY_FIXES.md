# Security Fixes Implementation Summary

## Completed Security Fixes

### 1. ✅ Removed Exposed Credentials
- Deleted `keys-to-remove.txt` containing exposed Anthropic API key
- `.env.local` already in `.gitignore` (was not exposed in git)
- Created `.env.example` with placeholder values

### 2. ✅ Protected Upload API
- Added authentication check to `/api/upload` endpoint
- Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Returns 401 Unauthorized without valid token

### 3. ✅ Protected Upload Page
- Added client-side redirect if no upload key is configured
- Simple protection to prevent casual access

### 4. ✅ Fixed XSS Vulnerabilities
- Installed DOMPurify for HTML sanitization
- Created `SanitizedContent` component for safe rendering
- Updated blog post rendering to use sanitization
- Updated About page to use sanitization

## Environment Variables to Set

Add these to your Vercel/Netlify deployment:

```env
# Required for Cloudinary uploads
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dqltlwqi2
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=194453126296877
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=[YOUR_SECRET_HERE]

# Required for upload protection
UPLOAD_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-upload-key-2024
NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-upload-key-2024
```

## Git History Cleanup (Still Needed)

To remove sensitive files from git history:

```bash
# Remove files from history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.local keys-to-remove.txt" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push (coordinate with team)
git push origin --force --all
```

## Testing

Run security tests:
```bash
npm test security.spec.ts
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Change Cloudinary API Secret** - Since it was exposed in `.env.local`
2. **Add Rate Limiting** - Consider adding rate limiting to prevent API abuse
3. **Add CSP Headers** - Add Content Security Policy headers for additional XSS protection
4. **Regular Security Audits** - Run `npm audit` regularly
5. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity** - Check Cloudinary logs for unauthorized usage

## Notes

- The upload page protection is basic (client-side redirect)
- For production, consider implementing proper authentication (NextAuth.js)
- The API key approach is simple but effective for basic protection
- XSS protection now sanitizes all user-generated content from CMS
