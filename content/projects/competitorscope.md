# CompetitorScope

## Overview

CompetitorScope is an advanced AI-powered competitive intelligence platform that transforms how businesses analyze and outperform their competition. By combining cutting-edge AI with comprehensive SEO analysis, it provides actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making.

## The Problem

Most businesses fly blind when it comes to their competition:
- **Manual Analysis is Time-Consuming**: Hours spent researching competitors
- **Surface-Level Data**: Most tools show what, not why or how
- **Reactive, Not Proactive**: Finding out about changes after it's too late
- **Information Overload**: Data without actionable insights

I built CompetitorScope to solve these problems with AI-driven intelligence.

## Technical Architecture

    D --> E[API/Frontend]
    F[Real-time Monitor] --> B
    G[Historical Database] --> C
```

### Backend Infrastructure

The backend is built for scale and reliability:

```python
# FastAPI backend with async processing
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
from celery import Celery
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()
celery_app = Celery('competitorscope', broker='redis://localhost')

@app.post("/analyze-competitor")
async def analyze_competitor(url: str, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    # Trigger async analysis
    task = celery_app.send_task('analyze.full_competitor_scan', args=[url])
    
    # Return immediately with job ID
    return {"job_id": task.id, "status": "processing"}

@celery_app.task
def full_competitor_scan(url: str):
    # 1. Crawl competitor website
    site_data = crawl_website(url)
    
    # 2. Extract SEO signals
    seo_metrics = extract_seo_metrics(site_data)
    
    # 3. AI analysis
    insights = ai_analyze(site_data, seo_metrics)
    
    # 4. Generate report
    return generate_report(insights)
```

### AI Analysis Engine

The core intelligence uses multiple AI models:

```python
# Multi-model AI analysis pipeline
class CompetitorAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gpt4 = OpenAI(model="gpt-4")
        self.claude = Anthropic(model="claude-3")
        self.custom_model = load_model("./models/competitor_patterns.pkl")
    
    async def analyze(self, competitor_data):
        # Parallel AI analysis
        tasks = [
            self.analyze_content_strategy(competitor_data),
            self.analyze_technical_seo(competitor_data),
            self.analyze_market_positioning(competitor_data),
            self.predict_next_moves(competitor_data)
        ]
        
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return self.synthesize_insights(results)
```

### Real-time Monitoring

The monitoring system tracks competitor changes 24/7:

```typescript
// Real-time change detection
export class CompetitorMonitor {
  private async detectChanges(competitor: Competitor) {
    const currentSnapshot = await this.captureSnapshot(competitor.url)
    const previousSnapshot = await this.getLastSnapshot(competitor.id)
    
    const changes = this.diffSnapshots(previousSnapshot, currentSnapshot)
    
    if (changes.significant) {
      await this.notifyUser(competitor.userId, changes)
      await this.triggerDeepAnalysis(competitor.id, changes)
    }
  }
  
  private async captureSnapshot(url: string): Promise<Snapshot> {
    return {
      content: await this.scrapeContent(url),
      seo: await this.analyzeSEO(url),
      performance: await this.measurePerformance(url),
      timestamp: new Date()
    }
  }
}
```

## Development with Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) was instrumental in building CompetitorScope's complex architecture:

### Data Pipeline Design
Claude Code helped architect the entire data pipeline:
- Designed the crawler with ethical rate limiting
- Built the ETL pipeline for processing competitor data
- Created efficient data models for storing historical snapshots

### AI Integration Strategy
```python
# Claude Code helped design this multi-stage AI pipeline
class AIInsightEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stages = [
            DataExtractionStage(),
            PatternRecognitionStage(),
            InsightGenerationStage(),
            RecommendationStage()
        ]
    
    async def process(self, competitor_data):
        result = competitor_data
        for stage in self.stages:
            result = await stage.process(result)
        return result
```

### Frontend Development
Claude Code created the interactive dashboard:
```typescript
// Real-time competitor tracking dashboard
export function CompetitorDashboard({ competitors }: Props) {
  const [liveData, setLiveData] = useState<CompetitorData[]>([])
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.competitorscope.com/live')
    
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const update = JSON.parse(event.data)
      setLiveData(prev => updateCompetitorData(prev, update))
    }
    
    return () => ws.close()
  }, [])
  
  return (
    <motion.div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {competitors.map(competitor => (
        <CompetitorCard
          key={competitor.id}
          competitor={competitor}
          liveData={liveData[competitor.id]}
        />
      ))}
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```
